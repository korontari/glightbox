Glightbox
=========

Glightbox is a javascript lightbox plugin.

This module provides a field formatter that allows a site visitor to click
on an image and view that image in a responsive lightbox modal or if there
are multiple images the modal can be configured to show all the images in
a slideshow format (see Gallery setting).

The lightbox display can be configured to include captions with the image
title and/or description. Captions can be placed either at the bottom, top,
left or right side of the lightbox. The position can be set globally (see
module configuration) or controlled for each node individually using a text
field.

Global confguration options can be found at: admin/config/media/glightbox

Additional configuration is available on the field formatter.
